A funny ghost client made by [captainboggle](https://github.com/CaptainBoggle/) and myself.

## Prerequisites
**Ensure that a Java 8 JDK is installed on your machine.** Forge versions below 1.13 do not support anything else.

In a shell environment or IDE, execute the `setupDecompWorkspace` gradlew task to download, extract and deobfuscate Minecraft and Forge assets. After this is complete, run the `runClient` task to start Minecraft.
